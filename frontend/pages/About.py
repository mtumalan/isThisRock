# Introduction to the Project
st.header("Project Overview")
st.write("""
'Is This Rock?' is a project developed by our team to explore how neural networks can classify music genres based on live recordings. 
The goal was to create a model capable of identifying 10 different music genres by extracting features from audio signals in real-time, 
providing instant feedback on whether a given recording belongs to a particular genre.

# Neural Network Information
st.header("Technology")
st.write("""
We built a neural network that extracts relevant features from live audio recordings, such as spectral properties, rhythm, and frequency content. 
The model was trained using a dataset containing labeled music genres, allowing it to distinguish between 10 different genres.
The core tools and technologies used in this project are:
- **Python** for the backend and data processing
- **TensorFlow** for neural network training
- **Streamlit** for the frontend interface
- **FastAPI** for API development and handling requests
